#path to the blast executable (NCBI blast)
-blastpath "blastpgp -j 3 -h 0.001"

#-formatdbpath
#path to the formatdb executable (NCBI)

#verbose mode (0-10)
-verbose 1

#-cpu
#number of CPU to use
-cpu 1

#-readblast
#read results from a former run

#do calculations or just show the interface
-docalc T

#-olddata
#read old data from a savefile

#-newseqs
#sequences present in newseqs are added to olddata and clustered

#-exhaustive
#when adding new sequences to existing data; how should the pairwise blast hits be computed?
